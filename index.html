LIST OF SUB PROGRAMS-

Practical 1.1: WAP to find average marks of five subjects of a student in a class.

Solution:

#include <iostream>

using namespacestd;

    int main(){

    int subjects, i; 

    float marks, total=0.0f, averageMarks, percentage;

        // Input number of subjects

         cout << "Enter number of subjects\n"; 

    cin >> subjects; 

        // Take marks of subjects as input

    cout << "Enter marks of subjects\n";

        for(i = 0; i < subjects; i++){

       cin >> marks;

       total += marks;

    }

         // Calculate Average

    averageMarks = total / subjects;

    cout << "Total Marks = "<< total; 

    cout << "\nAverage Marks = "<< averageMarks; 

        return0; 

}

Practical 1.2: WAP to swap first and last digits of any number. (For ex:-n=12345, Output:-52341)                                                                                      

Solution:

#include <iostream>

#include <math.h>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

int n, first, last, sum, digits, nn, a, b;

   cout <<"\n\n Find the number after swapping the first and last digits:\n";

   cout <<"-------------------------------------------------------------\n";

   cout <<" Input any number: ";

   cin >> n;

   digits =(int)log10(n);

   first = n /pow(10, digits);

   last = n %10;

   a = first *(pow(10, digits));

   b = n % a;

   n = b /10;

   nn = last *(pow(10, digits))+(n *10+ first);

   cout <<" The number after swaping the first and last digits are: "<< nn << endl;

}

Practical 1.3: WAP to generate the Fibonacci series up to user specified limit. Write all the missing terms (e.g. 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15…) also at the end.

Solution:

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

int n,c,first=0,second=1,next;

int a[20],i,j=0,count=0;

cout<<"Enter the no. of terms of Fibonacci series=";

cin>>n;

cout<<"Terms of Fibonacci series are"<<endl;

for(c=0;c<n;c++)

{

if(c<=1)

next=c;

else

{

next=first+second;

first=second;

second=next;

}

cout<<next<<endl;

if(next-first>1)

{

for(i=first+1; i<next; i++)

{

a[j]=i;

count++;

j++;

}

}

LIST OF SUB PROGRAMS-

Practical 3.1: Write a program to find the largest& smallest of three numbers. (Use inline function MAX and MIN)

Solution:

#include <stdio.h>

// macro/inline function to get max of 3 numbers

#define MAX(a,b,c) (a > b && a > c ? a : (b > c ? b : c))

// macro/inline function to get min of 3 numbers

#define MIN(a,b,c) (a < b && a < c ? a : (b < c ? b : c))

int main()

{

int x, y, z, large, small;

   // accept 3 numbers from console

printf("Enter 3 numbers: ");

scanf("%d%d%d", &x, &y, &z);



   // call inline function to get the max and min of inputed numbers

large = MAX(x, y, z);

small = MIN(x, y, z);

   // print the largest and smallest numbers

printf("\nMax between %d, %d, and %d is %d.", x, y, z, large);

printf("\nMin between %d, %d, and %d is %d.", x, y, z, small);

Practical 3.2: A dining hall can accommodate only 50 guests. Create a class to store seat number (Generated Automatically) and name of the guests who are seated on first come first seated basis. Define functions to display name of all guests along with seat number. Write a program to show the working of this class using the concept of static data member and static function    



Solution:

#include <iostream>

#define MAX_SIZE 50

using namespace std;

// definition of guest class as we are required guest name and seat number

class Guest {

public:

char name[50];

intseatno;

};



// defination of Hall class having function to allote and list guest

class Hall {

public:

       // static member data

staticint front, rear;

static Guest allGuest[MAX_SIZE];



       // static member function for alloting the seat to the guest in FIFO order

staticintalloteSeat() {

if (rear == (MAX_SIZE - 1)) {

cout<< "Hall is full!";

return 0;

           }



rear++;

cout<< "Enter Guest Name: ";

cin>>allGuest[rear].name;

allGuest[rear].seatno = rear + 1;

return 1;

       }



       // static member function to list the guests with name nad seat number

static void listGuest() {

while(++front <= rear) {

cout<< "\nGuest " <<allGuest[front].name << " is seated on seat S" <<allGuest[front].seatno<< ".";

           }

   Hall::alloteSeat();

   Hall::alloteSeat();

   Hall::alloteSeat();

   Hall::alloteSeat();

AIM – LEARN HOW TO USE CONSTRUCTOR AND DESTRUCTOR IN C++

PREREQUISITES- KNOWLEDGE OF CLASSES AND CONSTRUCTOR

LIST OF SUB PROGRAMS-



Practical 4.1: WAP to find area of rectangle using constructor overloading. Also define destructor to delete the memory allocated to objects.

Solution:
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

class area

{

  int a,l,b;

  public:

  area() // simple constructor definition.

  {

     l=5;

     b=6;

     cout<<"Simple constructor called\n";

     cout<<"length="<<l<<"\nbreadth="<<b<<endl;

  }

  area(int x,int y) // parameterised constructor

  {

     l=x;

     b=y;

  }

  void calc();

  void print();

  ~area();

};

void area::calc()

{

   a=l*b;

}

void area::print()

{

   cout<<"Area is : "<<a<<endl;

}

area::~area()

{

cout << "Object is being deleted" << endl;

}

int main()

{

   int l,b;

   area a1; // simple constructor is called.

   a1.calc();

   a1.print();

   cout<<"Enter length and breadth for parameterised        constructor:\n";

   cin>>l>>b;

   area a2(l,b); // parameterised constructor is called.

   a2.calc();

   a2.print();

   return 0;

}

Practical 4.2: WAP to create database of the following items: Name of the student (String), Roll number of the student (int), Height of the student (cm), Weight of the student (kg/gms)

1) Create a Constructor to initialize values

2) Create display () function to display the details

3) Illustrate the use of copy constructor

4) Also implement the concept of destructor.           

Solution:

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;



class student

{

           private:

                       string name;

                       int  rollNo;

                       int  height;

                       int weight;

           public:

                       student(string n,int r,int h,int w)

               {

                   name=n;

                   rollNo=r;

                   height=h;

                   weight=w;

                }

                       //member function to print student's details

                       void display(void);

                       ~student();

};



void student::display(void){

           cout << "Student details:\n";

           cout << "Name:"<< name << ",Roll Number:" << rollNo << ",Height:" << height << ",Weight:" << weight;

}

student :: ~student()

{

           cout<<"destructor is called\n";

}

int main()

{

           student std("mohit",1234,6,78);                    //object creation

           student std1=std;

           std1.display();

           

           return 0;

}
