LIST OF SUB PROGRAMS-

Practical 1.1: WAP to find average marks of five subjects of a student in a class.

Solution:

#include <iostream>

using namespacestd;

    int main(){

    int subjects, i; 

    float marks, total=0.0f, averageMarks, percentage;

        // Input number of subjects

         cout << "Enter number of subjects\n"; 

    cin >> subjects; 

        // Take marks of subjects as input

    cout << "Enter marks of subjects\n";

        for(i = 0; i < subjects; i++){

       cin >> marks;

       total += marks;

    }

         // Calculate Average

    averageMarks = total / subjects;

    cout << "Total Marks = "<< total; 

    cout << "\nAverage Marks = "<< averageMarks; 

        return0; 

}

Practical 1.2: WAP to swap first and last digits of any number. (For ex:-n=12345, Output:-52341)                                                                                      

Solution:

#include <iostream>

#include <math.h>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

int n, first, last, sum, digits, nn, a, b;

   cout <<"\n\n Find the number after swapping the first and last digits:\n";

   cout <<"-------------------------------------------------------------\n";

   cout <<" Input any number: ";

   cin >> n;

   digits =(int)log10(n);

   first = n /pow(10, digits);

   last = n %10;

   a = first *(pow(10, digits));

   b = n % a;

   n = b /10;

   nn = last *(pow(10, digits))+(n *10+ first);

   cout <<" The number after swaping the first and last digits are: "<< nn << endl;

}

Practical 1.3: WAP to generate the Fibonacci series up to user specified limit. Write all the missing terms (e.g. 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15…) also at the end.

Solution:

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

int n,c,first=0,second=1,next;

int a[20],i,j=0,count=0;

cout<<"Enter the no. of terms of Fibonacci series=";

cin>>n;

cout<<"Terms of Fibonacci series are"<<endl;

for(c=0;c<n;c++)

{

if(c<=1)

next=c;

else

{

next=first+second;

first=second;

second=next;

}

cout<<next<<endl;

if(next-first>1)

{

for(i=first+1; i<next; i++)

{

a[j]=i;

count++;

j++;

}

}

}

cout<<"Missing numbers of the Fibonacci series are:"<<endl;

for(j=0; j<count; j++)

cout<<a[j]<<endl;

return 0;

 Practical 2.1: WAP to input a matrix of dimension m*n. If base address is 1000. Find the address of (m-1, n-1) element of the matrix.

Solution:

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

      int main()

      {

             int b,i,j,w,lr=0,lc=0,n,m;

Practical 2.2: Create a class called employee with the following details as variables within it.

1. Name of the employee (string)

2. Age (int)

3. Designation (string)

4. Salary (double)

Write a program to create array of objects for the same to access these. Also, make use of member functions to accept values and print the name, age, designation and salary.         

Solution:

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

      class Employee

      {

             char Name[25];

             int Age;

             char Desg[8];

             long Salary;

             public:

             void GetData();

             void PutData();

      };

      void Employee :: GetData()          //Statement 1 : Defining GetData()

      {

              cout<<"\n\tEnter Employee Name : ";

             cin>>Name;

             cout<<"\n\tEnter Employee Age : ";

             cin>>Age;

                     cout<<"\n\tEnter Employee Designation:";

             cin>>Desg;



             cout<<"\n\tEnter Employee Salary : ";

             cin>>Salary;

      }



      void Employee :: PutData()          //Statement 2 : Defining PutData()

      {

             cout<<"\nEmployee Name : "<<Name;

             cout<<"\nEmployee Age : "<<Age;

             cout<<"\nEmployee Designation:"<<Desg;

             cout<<"\nEmployee Salary : "<<Salary;

      }



      int main()

      {

             Employee E[5];          //Statement 3 : Creating Object

             int i;

             for(i=0;i<5;i++)

             {

               E[i].GetData();         //Statement 4 : Calling GetData()

             }

             for(i=0;i<5;i++)

             {

               E[i].PutData();         //Statement 5 : Calling PutData()

             }

             return 0;



      }

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int my_variable = 10; // Global x

int main()

{

 int my_variable = 100; // Local x

 cout << "Value of global my_variable is " << ::my_variable<<endl;

 cout << "Value of local my_variable is " << my_variable<<endl;

 return 0;
